description: How to install and get started using CodeCage

import { Code, Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import CodeCage from "../../components/CodeCage.astro";

CodeCage is a Web Component to generate a CodePen like code viewing experience.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add code-cage
```

### Usage

```html
<code-cage use-slots>
  <span slot="html">{{my_html_snippet}}</span>
  <span slot="css">{{my_css_snippet}}</span>
  <span slot="js">{{my_js_snippet}}</span>
</code-cage>
<!-- Or using attributes -->
<code-cage
  html="{{my_html_snippet}}"
  css="{{my_css_snippet}}"
  js="{{my_js_snippet}}"
></code-cage>
```

<Aside>Make sure you include the script somewhere in your site.</Aside>

You can also add the attribute `dark` to get the dark version. This sets the CSS property `color-scheme`. This means that in your styles you can use the `light-dark()` function and it will automatically update inside your code.

### Styling

While the inside of the component exists in the Shadow DOM, there are a series of `::part()` selectors that you can use to style.

- `::part(button)`: Selects all the buttons in the top row.
- `::part(content-type)`: Selects the `<ul>` wrapping the html, css, and js buttons.
- `::part(controls)`: Selects the outer `<ul>` wrapping the content-type list and the copy button.
- `::part(output)`: Selects the output tabs.
- `::part(results)`: Selects the div wrapping the controls and the output.
- `::part(iframe)`: Selects the iframe.
- `::part(title)`: Selects the title. (If the title is unused, this doesn't select anything)
- `::part(host)`: Selects the outer most wrapper of the component.

There are also some custom properties that can be set if you don't want to mess with `::part()`

- `--cc-color`: Sets the color.
- `--cc-bg`: Sets the background of buttons and the `:host`.
- `--cc-results-bg`: Sets the background of the code tabs.
- `--cc-border`: Sets the border of the buttons and results.

<Aside>
`--cc-border` doesn't sets the whole `border` property.

Using `light-dark()` you can also take advantage of the `dark attribute`.

Here's an inaccessible example:

```css
code-cage {
  --bg: light-dark(limegreen, papayawhipe);
}
```

</Aside>

## Example

<CodeCage
  html="<div class='test'>Testing</div>"
  css=".test {
  color: limegreen;
}"
  js="(function() { console.log('testing') })()"
/>

## To do

- [ ] Set active language to show on load
- [x] As an Astro Component (Though it should work just fine as a web component)
- [ ] Support for markdown codeblocks _[Help Wanted]_
- [ ] Syntax Highlighting ([Check out this css tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/css-custom-highlight-api-early-look/))
- [ ] Make styles more configurable (`::part`, `--cc-prop-name`) _[Help Wanted]_
- [ ] Take advantage of DSD somehow (goes for styles too)
- [ ] Make it look better as a default _[Help Wanted]_
